Continue statement

The continue statement in c is used to force the next iteration of the loop.

for example:-

int main()
{
  int a=10;
  
  do
  {
    if(a==12)
    {
      a++;
      continue;
      printf("a=%d\n",a);
      
    }
    printf("The value of a=%d\n",a);
    a++;
   }while(a<15);
   
   return 0;
   }
   
   In this program the output will be 
   
   The value of a= 10
   The value of a= 11
   The value of a= 13
   The value of a= 14
   
   In this program the continue statement inside if will force the program to start over in the loop and resulted skip printing the statement value of a =12.
