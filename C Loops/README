C Loops

  There are several situation we need to execute a block of code several number of times.Thent se is done with the help of loops.
  In C we have different types of loops. 
  
  1. While loop
  2. for loop
  3. do while loop
  4. nested while loop
  5. nested for loop
  6. nested do while loop
  
  
  while loop
  
    while loop repeatedly execute a group of statement until certain condition is true.
    
    syntax:-
    
    initialize loop variable;
    while(condition)
    {
      statements;
      increment/decrement lop variable;
      
     }
     
     for loop
     
     for loop repeatedly execute a group of statement until certain condition is true.
     
     
     syntax:-
     
     for(initialize;condition;increment/decrement)
     {
        syntax;
        
      }
      
      do while loop
      
      do while loop is similar to while loop except the condition that it is garanteed to execute once.
      
      syntax:-
      
      do
      {
        statements;
        
       }while(condition);
       
       
       Nested loop in c
