Storage Classes

storage classes in c define the scope and life time of a variables in c.

The storage classes which can be used in c program are

1. auto 
2. register
3. static
4. extern

The auto storage class


The auto storage class is the default storage class for all local variables in c.

for example

int value=10;
auto int value=20;

are the same storage classes in c.


The register Storage Class


The register storage class the values are stored in CPU registers instead of RAM where normal variables are stored.  
The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters.Where the value should be stored also depends on hardware.

example:-register int count;


The static storage classes

The static storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during
the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into
and goes out of scope. 

for example

static int count=5;

we will discuss the scope of a variable in detail in upcoming leatures.


The external storage class


The extern storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to
all the program files. 

for example

first code
number.h

extern int a=10;
extern b=20;

Note: please note that the extension when you save the fole it is .h.

second code

sum.c

#include<stdio.h>
#include<number.h>
int main()
{
  int sum=a+b;
  printf("sum=%d",sum);
  return 0;
 }
 
 the result of the following program will be 30.
 
 you can also find the uploaded code above.
