# C Programming tutorials

Hi friends! Do you want to start a career as an Embedded software engineer? 
If yes, then it is worth investing your time in learning C. 
And this repository contains lots of exercise programs and descriptions that will definitely help you to start learning C from scratch.
 
Let us begin...
 
## Introduction ##

C is a general-purpose computer language developed by Dennis M Ritchie at the Bell laboratories.

### Now what is the significance of learning a programming language? ###

We humans can interact with each other verbally and physically using the languages we developed. And thus a programming language helps us to interact with computers or machines. Now maybe a question raises in your head. Do machines understand C programs? Not really! They can only speak one language the machine language, the On and Off language, or binary language which is a sequence of ones and zeros. And there is a program called a compiler that scans the C program and converts all of it to machine code.

### Why C?

1. A Deeper understanding of computers. In C, we are dealing with memory, pointers, inputs, and outputs that help us understand how computers work. Learning C is like learning to drive a manual car where you should understand the concept of gear systems more deeply while learning other programming languages like driving an automatic car.

2. Computer theories, Computer networks, and compilers are written in C. So learning C is worth it if you wanted to develop your operating systems.
