# C Arrays #

Friends, until now we used different variables to store different data?
What if we want to store a collection of data?

In C, we have a  data structure called the array, which can store a fixed size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

## Declaring Arrays in C ##

type arrayName [arraysize];

example:

int array1[20]
   
   The array is named array1, and it can store 20 integers.
    
## Initializing Arrays ##

int array1[5]={1,2,3,4,5};

array1 is initialized with values 1 to 5.

## Accessing Array Elements ##

Array elements are accessed using indexing. 

int array1[5]={1,2,3,4,5};

for example array1[0]=1;
array1[1]=2
array1[4]=5

Now, you should have noticed that the array indexing begins with 0.
