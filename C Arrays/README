# C Arrays #

Friends, until now we used different variable to store different datas?
What if we want to store a collection of data?

For that in C we hve a  data structure called the array , which can store a fixed size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

## Declaring Arrays in C ##

type arrayName [arraysize];

example:

int array1[20]
    This declared an array named array1 which can store 20 integers.
    
## Initializing Arrays ##

int array1[5]={1,2,3,4,5};

array1 is initialized with walues 1 to 5.

## Accessing Array Elements ##

Array elements are accessed using indexing. 
int array1[5]={1,2,3,4,5};

for example array1[0]=1;
array1[1]=2
array1[4]=5

now that you should have noticed that the array indexing begin with 0.
