Constants

The constants refered to a fixed value that the program may not alter during the execution.
Constants can be of any data type like an integer constant, float point constant, and char constant.

Literals

Literals are the constant values assign to the constant variables we can also say that it is afixed value that cannot be changed.

An Integer literal

An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant.

some examples are
55      // decimal 
0213    // octal 
0x4b    // hexadecimal 
30      // int 
30u     // unsigned int 
30l     // long 
30ul    // unsigned long 

Floating point literals

floating point literals has an integer part, decimal part and exponent part.

some examples are
3.14159 
314159E-5L 

Character constants

Character literals are enclosed in single quotes 'a' and can be stored in a simple
variable of char type.There are certain charaters in c preceded by backslash have a special meaning in c.

example:-'/n'-new line, '/t'-one tab space.

String literals

String literals or constants are enclosed in double quotes. 

some examples of string literals are

Here are some examples of string literals. All the three forms are identical strings.
"Hello, World"
"Hello, \
World"
"Hello, " "W" "orld"

Defining Constants

There are two simple ways in C to define constants:
1. Using #define preprocessor.
  We will discuss this in details in another section.
2. Using const keyword.
  for example -const pi=3.14;
  
  Refer the attachment programs for detail understanding.
