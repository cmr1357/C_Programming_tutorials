# C Program structures

A C program consists of the following parts.

1. Preprocessor Commands
2. Functions
3. Variables
4. Statements & Expressions
5. Comments

Now let us take a look at the following program.

// My first C program ##
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    
  printf("Hellow World\n");
  
  return 0;
 }

Now we wrote our first C program! 

Let me explain it from the beginning so that you can understand every line in the program.

First, we begin with a "//" sign which is known as comments in the program and is ignored by the compiler.
These two forward slashes help us to add little comments or notes to the program.
 
In this program, the #include is a preprocessor command which tells the compiler to include stdio.h file before going to the program,
and the stdio.h file has the necessary information to include the input and output related functions in our program.

The int main() is the main function where program execution begins.

Now the printf, which is a function available in c which causes the message "Hello world" to be displayed on the screen.

return 0, terminate the main function, and return value 0.


## C Basic syntax ##

### Tokens in c ###

A token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of
five tokens:

printf("hello world");

the individual tokens are

1. printf
2. "
3. hello world
4. (
5. ;

### Semicolon in C ###

The semicolon is a statement terminator in C and each statement should end with a semicolon in the C program and it indicates the end of one logical entity.

### Identifiers ###

An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item.
Now let us look at the following program to print an integer value.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   int value=10;
   printf("Value=%d",value);
 
   return 0;
 }

In this program "value" is a variable that store 10. Value is considered an identifier.
There are certain rules to follow and the rules are described below.

 1. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore _ followed by zero
or more letters ,  underscores, and digits (0 to 9).

2. C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers.

3. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different
identifiers in C.

### Keywords ###
 
Keywords are reserved word in c which has a specific meaning to the C compiler.
Listed are some keywords in C.
auto,else,beak,continue,char,float,int...
 
### Whitespace in C ###
 
Whitespace is known as a blank line, and a C compiler ignores it.
 
int age=1;

In this statement, there should have at least one whitespace between the int and age so that the compiler could easily distinguish them.

Now I hope you understood the C programming structure and syntax.
